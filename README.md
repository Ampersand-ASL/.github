# The Ampserand Linking Project

The purposes of this project:
* To provide hams with a simple way to link radios to 
the [AllStarLink](https://www.allstarlink.org) network. Radio-less applications are also supported (conference
hubs, direct audio connections, etc.). 
* To provide a platform for research and experimentation to advance the state-of-the-art
around ham radio linking.
* To maintain compatibility with the rest of the ASL ecosystem. This **is not** a fork
of ASL or an attempt to create a parallel network.
