The purpose of this project:
* To provide hams with a simple way to link radios to 
the [AllStarLink](https://www.allstarlink.org) network. Radio-less applications are also supported (conference
hubs, direct audio connections, etc.). 
* To provide a platform for research and experimentation to advance the state-of-the-art
around ham radio linking.
* To maintain compatibility with the rest of the ASL ecosystem. This **is not** a fork
of ASL or an attempt to create a parallel network.

This project was originated in October of 2025 by [Bruce MacKinnon (KC1FSZ)](https://www.qrz.com/db/KC1FSZ)
of the [Wellesley Amateur Radio Society](https://ema.arrl.org/wellesley-amateur-radio-society/) in Wellesley, MA. Please reach out using the e-mail address in QRZ. You can also try me on AllStar 
node 672730, as long as I'm not in the middle of a compile.

This follows a very [similar project for EchoLink](https://github.com/brucemack/microlink).
